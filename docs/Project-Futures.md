# Project Futures

## Camera & Control Ideas
- Add a subtle camera collision/pushback volume to prevent clipping through nearby geometry in tight spaces.
- Offer a per-mode sensitivity slider and invert-Y toggle in an in-game settings panel.
- Add a soft follow camera spring for third-person to emphasize momentum when sprinting or landing.
- Introduce lightweight environment collision volumes so the player and camera avoid interpenetrating props.
