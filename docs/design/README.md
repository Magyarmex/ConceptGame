# Design Document Index

This folder is the shared space for all game design documents. Each doc focuses on a specific area so ideas can be captured, revisited, and refined without getting lost in chat history.

## Core Docs
- [Game Vision](./Game-Vision.md)
- [Player & Combat Design](./Player-Combat-Design.md)
- [Minion Design](./Minion-Design.md)
- [Maps & Objectives](./Maps-Objectives.md)
- [Economy & Progression](./Economy-Progression.md)
- [UX & Readability](./UX-Readability.md)
- [Future Ideas](./Future-Ideas.md)

## Working Conventions
- Keep sections short and scannable.
- Add new ideas as bullets before refactoring into structured sections.
- Prefer examples, “rules of thumb,” and testable hypotheses.
- Tag open questions with **OPEN** so they are easy to track.
