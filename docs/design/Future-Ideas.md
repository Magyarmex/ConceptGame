# Future Ideas

A curated list of forward-looking concepts. Only items that are not implemented or not decided belong here.

## Roguelike Perk System (Skill-Multiplying Builds)
- **Goal:** Amplify skill expression with run-scoped perks, without introducing RNG or hard metas.
- **Core idea:** Use deterministic, skill-gated choices rather than random pools.

### Deterministic Selection (No RNG)
- Fixed milestone choices (e.g., after objectives or time intervals).
- Performance-gated unlocks (headshot streaks, perfect dodges, clean ability chains).
- Objective-driven unlocks (map control enables specific perk branches).

### Skill-Triggered Effects
- Aim: headshot streaks trigger short team focus-fire boosts.
- Movement: perfect dodge grants brief speed and minion rally.
- Timing: ability chains after kills grant cooldown refunds.

### Meta-Resistance Without Manual Balancing
- Hard category caps (only one mobility, one burst, one control perk).
- Built-in counterplay: perks must create visible weaknesses.
- Sidegrades over raw upgrades to avoid clear best-in-slot picks.

### Open Questions
- **OPEN:** How to ensure perk choices feel meaningful without RNG.
- **OPEN:** Whether perks remain PvE-only or are allowed in PvP.
