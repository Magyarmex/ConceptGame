# Game Vision

## High-Level Pillars
- **Player-first action:** the player is always the highest-impact actor.
- **Minions as amplifiers:** minions magnify player intent and skill, not replace it.
- **High skill ceiling:** mastery comes from movement, aim, timing, and tactical decisions.
- **Readable combat:** low-poly visual language keeps battles legible at speed.
- **Multiplayer core with PvE depth:** 1v1s and small squad engagements supported by a PvE/campaign layer.

## Core Loop (Draft)
1. **Gather** resources via combat and objective play.
2. **Spawn** minions as tactical extensions.
3. **Command** with lightweight inputs (attack/defend/focus).
4. **Skirmish** with high-tempo player duels + minion clashes.
5. **Reset/rotate** objectives to maintain pace.

## Non-Goals (Avoid RTS Drift)
- No base building or long queues.
- No top-down tactical camera.
- No large-scale army management.

## Open Questions
- **OPEN:** Match length targets and round structure.
- **OPEN:** Competitive vs. co-op emphasis.
