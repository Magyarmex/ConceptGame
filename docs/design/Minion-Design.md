# Minion Design

## Purpose
Minions are **tactical extensions** of the player, not an alternative win condition. Their power should feel meaningful but never outshine the player.

## Design Goals
- **Player-first:** the player remains the most impactful actor.
- **Synergy-driven:** minions respond to player skill and intent.
- **Low cognitive load:** a few strong commands with fast response.
- **High clarity:** visible feedback makes their impact feel real.

## Avoiding RTS Drift
- Cap active minion count (e.g., 3–6 on field).
- Keep controls to “smart commands” (attack/defend/focus).
- Avoid long-term build queues and base-building systems.

## Minion Roles (Draft)
- **Vanguard:** shields, frontline soaking, push enablers.
- **Skirmisher:** fast pressure, flanks, melee disruption.
- **Ranged Drone:** poke, suppression, node defense.
- **Support:** buffs, heals, debuffs, resource utility.
- **Specialist:** EMP, vision, stealth disruption, area denial.

## Player-Skill Synergies
### Aim-Linked
- **Tag → Focus:** minions prioritize targets the player hits or pings.
- **Combo windows:** precision hits open short damage/utility buffs.

### Movement-Linked
- **Proximity bonuses:** minions fight better near the player.
- **Motion triggers:** sliding/wall-riding triggers a rally or shield pulse.

### Timing-Linked
- **Burst windows:** minion abilities become stronger if triggered shortly after a player ability.
- **Reactive counters:** successful player dodges open a brief minion counter-attack.

### Decision-Linked
- **Target intent:** minions follow the player’s target selection.
- **Risk-reward overclock:** temporary minion boost at cost of a player cooldown.

## Hero Moments (Minion Clutch Events)
A **hero moment** is a short, dramatic minion action that clearly saves or empowers the player **because of player skill**.

### Defensive Saves
- Minion blocks a lethal shot after the player triggers “Guard.”
- Body-block occurs after the player pings “defend.”

### Offensive Clutch
- Player primes a target; minion finishes with a dramatic strike.
- Player lands a precision hit; minion unleashes a coordinated burst.

### Tactical Turning Points
- Player tags a choke; minions fortify it instantly.
- Player repositioning triggers a minion flank pinch.

### Why They Matter
- **Emotional payoff:** feels like a high-five, not babysitting.
- **Ownership:** player feels “I caused this.”
- **Retention:** memorable moments make minions feel cool, not burdensome.

## Feedback & UX
- Strong VFX/audio when a hero moment triggers.
- Clear UI pulses or callouts (“Saved by Minion”).
- Visible causality: show that the player’s input triggered the effect.

## Rules of Thumb
- If the player didn’t do something skillful, it shouldn’t trigger a hero moment.
- Minions should help win **moments**, not entire matches alone.
- If a player can win by hiding and commanding, it’s too RTS.

## Open Questions
- **OPEN:** Exact minion cap and lifetime.
- **OPEN:** How often hero moments should occur to feel special.
- **OPEN:** Which minion archetypes are mandatory vs. optional.
