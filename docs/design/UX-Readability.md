# UX & Readability

## Visual Language
- Low-poly silhouettes for instant recognition.
- Color-coded effects for player vs. minion actions.

## UI Principles
- Minimal HUD clutter, player-centric view.
- Minion status as **lightweight signals**, not a control panel.

## Feedback Loops
- Clear hit feedback for player shots.
- Hero moment callouts to celebrate minion impact.

## Open Questions
- **OPEN:** Which callouts feel best without cluttering the screen.
